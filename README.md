# LP2_Classification
Telecom companies operate in a highly competitive industry, and customer churn is one of their biggest challenges. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop using a companyâ€™s services. This is a significant problem for telecom companies because acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, companies need to identify customers who are likely to churn and take appropriate measures to retain them. In this article, I will discuss a customer churn prediction model and retention strategies for telecom companies. I will use a classification model to predict customer churn and suggest some retention strategies that can be implemented to reduce churn rates.

## Project Description
The project analysis aim was to identify the key indicators of customer churn for a telecommunications company and develop a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn. The project provided insights into effective retention strategies that the company can implement to reduce customer churn. The data was processed and analyzed using various techniques such as data cleaning, bivariate and multivariate analysis, and exploratory data analysis. The best-performing model was selected and evaluated, and suggestions for model improvement were provided. The ultimate goal of this project was to help the telecommunications company reduce customer churn and improve customer retention.
